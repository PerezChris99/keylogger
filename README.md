# keylogger
A keylogger made in python that when executed, and left running in the background, captures and stores keyboard keystrokes and stores them in a file.
This python file can be converted to an executable(.exe) file so as to make it easy to run on windows machines.
It works effectively in the background, and its almost invisble to a non-keen eye

Python libraries used include:
Pynput
logging

which enable capturing keystrokes and storing them in a file
